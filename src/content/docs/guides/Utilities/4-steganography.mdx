Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message or medium. In this guide, we will explore using steganography to hide messages in images and bitmaps.

## What is Steganography?

Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message or medium. The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "steganos" and "graphein," which mean "covered" and "writing," respectively. Steganography is often used to hide messages in images, audio files, and other digital media. The goal of steganography is to hide the existence of the message, so that it is not detected by anyone other than the intended recipient. Steganography is often used in conjunction with encryption to provide an additional layer of security.

### How Does Steganography Work?

Steganography works by embedding a message within another message or medium. In the case of images, steganography involves hiding a message within the pixels of the image. The message is typically encoded as a series of bits, which are then embedded in the least significant bits of the image pixels. The human eye is not sensitive to small changes in the least significant bits of an image, so the message is effectively hidden from view. To extract the hidden message, the recipient must know the encoding scheme used to embed the message and must have access to the original image. The recipient can then extract the hidden message by examining the least significant bits of the image pixels.

### Using Steganography to Hide Messages in Images

There are many different techniques for hiding messages in images using steganography. One common technique is to replace the least significant bits of the image pixels with the bits of the message. This technique is known as least significant bit (LSB) steganography. This will be the technique we will explore in this guide, as it is relatively simple and easy to implement. We will also use base64 encoding to encode the message before embedding it in the image, as well as for decoding the message after extracting it from the image.

#### How to Hide a Message in an Image

To start, you can use any image you would like for this, but for this guide we will use a bitmap image of a cat. You can download the image [here](https://example.com/cat.bmp). Once you have the image, you can use the following code in either C++, csharp or python for encoding a message into this bitmap.

:::note
You will need to update the path to be the path to your image file.

#### Expected Output

After running the code in your terminal, you should see an outpujt that shows the message you embedded, its encoded form, the length of the message and the length of bits used to encode the message. Which should look like this:

```plaintext
Enter the message to embed: 
im a cat
Base64-encoded message: aW0gYSBjYXQ=
Base64 length (in characters): 12
Length bits: 00000000000000000000000000001100
Message embedded successfully in Base64! Encoded image saved as /yourfolders/hiddencat.bmp.
```
