Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message or medium. In this guide, we will explore how to use steganography to hide messages in images and bitmaps, delving into concepts, techniques, and practical examples.

## What is Steganography?

Steganography is an ancient technique of hiding information in plain sight. The term is derived from the Greek words steganos (covered) and graphein (writing), meaning "covered writing." Unlike encryption, which scrambles the content of a message to make it unreadable to unauthorized parties, steganography disguises the very existence of the message by embedding it within another seemingly innocuous medium, such as an image, audio file, or text document.

Modern digital steganography often takes advantage of the characteristics of multimedia files to hide information. Images are particularly useful for this purpose because their pixel data provides a high degree of redundancy, which means small changes in pixel values are imperceptible to the human eye. For added security, steganography is frequently combined with encryption, ensuring that even if a hidden message is discovered, it remains unreadable without the proper decryption key.

### Applications of Steganography

Steganography has a range of applications, both benign and malicious. Legitimate uses include watermarking to protect intellectual property, secure communication in censorship-prone environments, and embedding metadata for digital forensics. However, it has also been misused for covert communication in cybercrime and espionage. This dual-use nature makes it a fascinating but critical subject in cybersecurity.

## How Does Steganography Work?

At its core, digital steganography involves embedding a secret message within a host medium. For images, this is typically done by modifying the binary representation of pixel values. Each pixel in a digital image is represented by a combination of red, green, and blue (RGB) color values. These values are stored as binary numbers, allowing for subtle alterations to be made without visibly affecting the image.

The most common method is Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography, where the least significant bit (the last bit in a binary number) of each pixel is replaced with a bit from the secret message. This approach leverages the fact that small changes to the least significant bit have negligible visual impact on the image.

For example, consider the binary representation of a pixel's red channel:

```plaintext
Original: 11110010
Modified: 11110011
```

The difference between these two values is imperceptible to the human eye, but the change encodes a bit of the hidden message.

To ensure the hidden message can be retrieved, both the sender and receiver must agree on an encoding scheme. This includes specifying which bits will carry the hidden data and how the message length will be encoded.

### Why Use Base64 Encoding?

Before embedding the message, encoding it in a format like Base64 is common. Base64 ensures that the message is represented using only printable characters, making it easier to handle and less prone to corruption during transmission. This step is particularly useful when the message contains non-textual or binary data.

## Using Steganography to Hide Messages in Images

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to use steganography to hide messages within bitmap images using LSB steganography. This technique is straightforward, making it ideal for beginners, while still being robust enough to illustrate the core principles of steganography.

### Embedding a Message in an Image

To hide a message:

1. **Choose an Image:** Any bitmap image can be used, but high-resolution images provide more space for hiding data. For this guide, we'll use a bitmap image of a cat.

2. **Prepare the Message:** The message will be encoded in Base64 before embedding to ensure compatibility and readability.

3. **Embed the Message:** Using LSB steganography, replace the least significant bits of the image's pixel data with bits from the encoded message.

### Code Example

Here is how you can embed a message in an image using C++, C#, or Python:

:::note
You will need to update the path to be the path to your image file.

```cpp

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="C#">

```csharp

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Python">

```python

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Expected Output

After embedding the message, you'll see an output like:

```plaintext
Enter the message to embed: 
im a cat
Base64-encoded message: aW0gYSBjYXQ=
Base64 length (in characters): 12
Length bits: 00000000000000000000000000001100
Message embedded successfully in Base64! Encoded image saved as /yourfolders/hiddencat.bmp.
```

## Extracting a Message from an Image

To retrieve the hidden message, the recipient must reverse the embedding process. This involves:

1. Reading the modified bitmap image.
2. Extracting the least significant bits of the pixel data.
3. Decoding the Base64-encoded message to retrieve the original message.

### Code Example

Here is how you can extract a message from an image using C++, C#, or Python:

:::note

### Expected Output

After extracting the message, you'll see an output like:

```plaintext
Length bits: 00000000000000000000000000001100
Extracted Base64 length (in characters): 12
Extracted message: im a cat
```
