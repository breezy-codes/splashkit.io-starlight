Imagine a world where your programs can talk to each other, share information, and work together seamlessly across different devices. This guide will show you how to build the foundational blocks for this kind of communication using simple server and client programs. We'll start by setting up a server that listens for incoming connections and processes data sent by clients. Then, we’ll move on to creating a client that can connect to this server, send messages, and receive responses. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to build basic networking applications.

But this is just the beginning. The concepts and code you learn here can be extended in countless ways:

- Multiplayer Games: Develop real-time multiplayer games where players interact with each other over a network.
- Chat Applications: Create chat applications that support multiple users communicating simultaneously.
- Remote Control: Build applications that allow you to control devices remotely, such as smart home systems.
- Data Sharing: Implement systems for sharing data between different programs, like file transfer applications or collaborative tools.

The possibilities are endless!

## Server and Client Programs

The server program is responsible for working as the program to which other programs connect. It listens for incoming connections and processes the data sent by the clients. The server program is built using the `create_server_with_port`, found [here](https://splashkit.io/api/networking/#create-server-1), function to establish a server that listens for incoming connections on the specified port. The server program then processes the data sent by the clients and sends a confirmation message back to the client.

The client program is the program that connects to the server program. It sends messages to the server and receives responses. The client program is built using the by using `open_connection`, found [here](https://splashkit.io/api/networking/#open-connection) to establish a connection to the server. 

These two programs can then be extended in any way imaginable to create programs that can communicate with each other over the network.

## Part 1: Establishing a Connection

To start, lets work on building two programs that can establish a connection with each other. We will build a simple server program that listens for incoming connections and prints the connection received. We will also build a simple client program that connects to the server and keeps the connection open.

### Server Program

The server program establishes a server with `create_server_with_port` and listens for incoming connections. When a connection is received, it prints a message to the console. The server program keeps the connection open until the client disconnects. The key to keeping the connections open when building programs that communicate is to use the `check_network_activity` function to monitor network activity.

            while (is_connection_open(client_connection)) {
                check_network_activity();
            }

            // Client disconnected
            write_line("Client " + std::to_string(client_ip) + " disconnected.");
        }
    }

    // Close the server
    if (server != nullptr) {
        close_server(server);
    }
    write_line("Server closed.");
}

int main() {
    start_server("MyServer", 65432);
    return 0;

### Running the Programs 

To run these two programs, you must start the server first. Depending on the programming language you use, this will vary. The example below was done using the cpp version of the server and client programs. Once you've started the server, you can then start the client program. The client program will connect to the server and you should see and keep the connection open until you close the client program.

In your server program you should see the following output when you first start it:

```bash
Server 'MyServer' started, listening on port 65432
```

Then start the client program and you should see the following output if your client program started successfully:
    
```bash
Connected to server at 127.0.0.1:65432
```

Looking back at the server program, there should be a new line that says:

```bash
Connected by 2130706433
```
