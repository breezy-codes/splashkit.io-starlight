This article covers use cases on how to use different network functions in your programs.

These functions are used in the tutorials:

## Servers

In order to connect two programs together, you need to build a host program. This will function as a server, and it can be done using this server function:

### Create Server with Port

In our tutorial, we used the `create_server_with_port` function, as detailed [here](https://splashkit.io/api/networking/#create-server), to establish a server within our host program. This function sets up the server to listen for incoming connections on the specified port. We then print a confirmation message using an f-string to display the server name and port number:

  <TabItem label="Python">

```python
server = create_server_with_port(name, port)
print(f"Server '{name}' started, listening on port {port}")
```

  </TabItem>

## Checking for Network Activity

The key to enabling communication between programs is to check for network activity, which is essential for both the host and the clients (programs that connect to the host). Use the `check_network_activity` function, as detailed [here](https://splashkit.io/api/networking/#check-network-activity), to monitor network activity.
