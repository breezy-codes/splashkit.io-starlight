Once you have installed the [Command Line Tools](/installation/linux/step-1/) you can install SplashKit and build the SplashKit library from its source.

## Steps

1. Open up a terminal.

    ![Opening a terminal](/gifs/linux/open-terminal.gif)

2. Install the SplashKit Manager by copy/pasting the command below into your terminal and press enter.

    ```shell
    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splashkit/skm/master/install-scripts/skm-install.sh)
    ```

3. Restart the terminal and execute `skm` to test it was successfully installed.

    ```shell
    skm
    ```

    You should see the following messages:

    ```shell
    SplashKit is installed successfully!
    Missing skm command. For help use 'skm help'
    ```

4. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies and compile splashkit.

    ```shell
    skm linux install
    ```

    If you encounter a dependency issue, you can install the dependencies manually using the following commands:

    <Tabs syncKey="linux-distro">
    <TabItem label="Ubuntu/Debian">
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install cmake libpng-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-net-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libmikmod-dev libncurses5-dev libbz2-dev libflac-dev libvorbis-dev libwebp-dev libfreetype6-dev build-essential clang
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Arch (pacman)">
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S cmake libpng sdl2 sdl2_ttf sdl2_image sdl2_net sdl2_mixer sdl2_gfx clang freetype2 ncurses bzip2 flac libvorbis libmikmod libwebp
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Arch (yay)">
    ```bash
    yay -S cmake libpng sdl2 sdl2_ttf sdl2_image sdl2_net sdl2_mixer sdl2_gfx clang freetype2 ncurses bzip2 flac libvorbis libmikmod libwebp
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Fedora">
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install cmake libpng SDL2 SDL2_ttf SDL2_image SDL2_net SDL2_mixer SDL2_gfx clang freetype ncurses bzip2 flac libvorbis libmikmod libwebp
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Alpine">
    ```bash
    sudo apk add cmake libpng sdl2 sdl2_ttf sdl2_image sdl2_net sdl2_mixer sdl2_gfx clang freetype ncurses bzip2 flac libvorbis libmikmod libwebp
    ```
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

5. Update your `bash` or `zsh` profile to add the splashkit library to your path.

    <Tabs syncKey="bash-zsh">
    <TabItem label="bash">
    Open your ~/.bashrc profile:
    ```bash
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```
    Then add the following two lines near the end of the file:
    ```bash
    export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.splashkit:$PATH"
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/.splashkit/lib/linux:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
    ```
    Then run the following command to update your profile:
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="zsh">
    Open your `.zshrc` file:
    ```bash
    nano ~/.zshrc
    ```
    Then add the following two lines near the end of the file:
    ```bash
    export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.splashkit:$PATH"
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/.splashkit/lib/linux:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
    ```
    Then run the following command to update your profile:
    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs> 

6. Run the following command to install splashkit globally.

    ```shell
    skm global install
    ```
