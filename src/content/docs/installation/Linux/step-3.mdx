Once you have finished the [install splashkit](/installation/linux/step-2/) step, you can download and install Visual Studio Code to use as a source code editor.

## Steps for Ubuntu/Debian and Fedora

1. Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

    If in Ubuntu/Debian then download the .deb package, or in Fedora download the .rpm package.

3. Install Visual Studio Code

    In the terminal window, change directory using the ```cd``` command to the directory where Visual Studio Code downloaded.

    ```shell
    cd ~/Downloads
    ```

    Then, install the .deb package by copying and pasting the code below into your terminal and pressing enter.

    <Tabs syncKey="ubuntu-fedora">
    <TabItem label="Ubuntu/Debian">
    ```bash
    sudo dpkg -i code_1.*.deb
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Fedora">
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install code-1.*.rpm
    ```
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

## Steps for Arch

For Arch Linux, you can install the community-maintained Visual Studio Code from the AUR.

```bash

Or the open source version:

```bash
yay -S code
```
