SplashKit works with a number of programming languages. Each of these has its own set of tools you will need to install.

### For C# .NET

To install .NET for using C# with Splashkit, this will depend on your Linux distribution. You can find the instructions for all Linux distributions on the [.NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download?initial-os=linux).

- For Ubuntu, you can follow the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu).
- For Debian, you can follow the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-debian).
- For Fedora, you can follow the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-fedora).
- For Arch, you will need to install the `dotnet-sdk` package from the AUR.
  - You can do this with:

    ```bash
    yay -S dotnet-sdk
    ```

  - You can also install the `dotnet-runtime` package if you only want to run .NET applications with the command:
  
    ```bash
    yay -S dotnet-runtime
    ```

The .NET install should automatically update the bash or zsh file. If you encounter any issues, you can manually add the library to your path.

export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet
```
Then run the following command to update your profile:

### For C++

For C++, you (should) _already_ be ready to go.

### For Python

Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. If not, you can install it using the package manager for your distribution.

#### Installing Python

For Ubuntu/Debian, Arch, Fedora, and Alpine, you can install Python 3 using the following commands:

<Tabs syncKey="linux-distro">
<TabItem label="Ubuntu/Debian">

For Installing python3 run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt install python3
```

Optionally, you can also install `pip`:
