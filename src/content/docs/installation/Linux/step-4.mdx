SplashKit supports multiple programming languages, each with its own set of tools. Follow the instructions below to install the required tools for your language of choice.

## Language-Specific Installations

### C# (.NET)

To develop with C# in SplashKit, you’ll need to install .NET. Installation methods vary by Linux distribution:

    To install .NET SDK on Arch:

    ```bash
    yay -S dotnet-sdk
    ```

    To install only the .NET runtime (for running .NET apps without development tools):

    ```bash
    yay -S dotnet-runtime
    ```

  </details>

If the .NET installer does not automatically update your shell profile, you can manually add it:

Open your `~/.bashrc` file:

```
Add the following lines near the end:
```bash
export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet
```
Apply the changes:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="zsh">
Open your `.zshrc` file:
```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```
Add the following lines near the end:
```bash
export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet
```
Apply the changes:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</details>

### C++

For C++, you should already have the necessary tools if you have a standard Linux development environment. No additional setup is required specifically for SplashKit.

---

### Python

Most Linux distributions include Python pre-installed. If Python isn’t installed, or if you need additional Python tools, follow the steps below.

<Steps>

1. **Installing Python**

   Install Python 3 and `pip` (Python package installer) using the following commands based on your Linux distribution:

   <Tabs syncKey="linux-distro">
   <TabItem label="Ubuntu/Debian">
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
   ```
   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="Arch">
   <Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
   <TabItem label="With pacman">
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S python python-pip
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="With yay">
   ```bash
   yay -S python python-pip
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>
   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="Fedora">
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip
   ```
   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="Alpine">
   ```bash
   sudo apk add python3 py3-pip
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   ---

2. **Verify Installation (Optional)**

  To confirm that Python and `pip` are successfully installed, check the versions:

  ```bash
  python3 --version
  pip3 --version
  ```

  Both commands should output version information if the installation was successful.

</Steps>

### Other Languages

Support for other languages such as Pascal are coming soon.
