SplashKit works with a number of programming languages. Each of these has its own set of tools you will need to install.

### For C# .NET

To install .NET for using C# with Splashkit, this will depend on your Linux distribution. You can find the instructions for all Linux distributions on the [.NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download?initial-os=linux).

- For Ubuntu, you can follow the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu).
- For Debian, you can follow the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-debian).
- For Fedora, you can follow the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-fedora).
- For Arch, you will need to install the `dotnet-sdk` package from the AUR.
  - You can do this with:

    ```bash
    yay -S dotnet-sdk
    ```

  - You can also install the `dotnet-runtime` package if you only want to run .NET applications with the command:
  
    ```bash
    yay -S dotnet-runtime
    ```

The .NET install should automatically update the bash or zsh file. If it doesn't, then add the following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

<Tabs syncKey="bash-zsh">
<TabItem label="bash">
Open your `~/.bashrc` profile:
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```
Then add the following two lines near the end of the file:
```bash
export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet
```
Then run the following command to update your profile:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="zsh">
Open your `.zshrc` file:
```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```
Then add the following two lines near the end of the file:
```bash
export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet
```
Then run the following command to update your profile:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs> 

### For C++

- For C++, you (should) _already_ be ready to go.

Guides for other supported languages like Python and Pascal are coming soon.

## What's next?

Congratulations! If you've followed these steps correctly, then you will have
installed all the tools needed to start programming with SplashKit!

It's time to get programming...
