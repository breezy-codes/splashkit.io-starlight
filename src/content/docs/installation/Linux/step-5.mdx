The SplashKit SDK is regularly updated to ensure compatibility with the latest features and bug fixes. If you encounter issues with a SplashKit function or notice discrepancies between your system's SDK and the documentation, you may need to update SplashKit.

## Updating SplashKit on Linux

To update SplashKit on your system, use the following command:

```bash
skm update
```

### How the Update Works

The `skm update` command performs several steps to ensure that your SplashKit installation is current:

1. **Check for Dependencies**: Ensures any new dependencies required by the update are installed.
2. **Check Branch Status**: Verifies that your SplashKit branch is up-to-date.
3. **Rebuild SplashKit**: Recompiles the library files if updates are detected, ensuring all components are in sync.

This command operates similarly to `skm linux install`, performing a complete check and refresh of your installation to match the latest SplashKit version.
