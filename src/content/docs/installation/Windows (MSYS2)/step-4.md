To install the .NET tools for using C# with Splashkit, you will need to install the [Dotnet core](/installation/windows-msys2/languages/dotnet/) tools.

### For C++

For C++, you (should) _already_ be ready to go.

For Python, you will need to download the [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) installer and install it on your system.

#### Optional Features

During the installation process, you may be asked to select optional features. You can select these based on your needs. For example, you may want to install `pip`.

#### Advanced Steps
