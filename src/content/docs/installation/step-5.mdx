## Updating SplashKit

The SplashKit SDK library is regularly updated, if a SplashKit function isn't working in your system, or the site has one that you don't have, you may need to update your system.

In order to update splashit on your system you need to run the command -

```bash
skm update
```

Which updates splashkit by checking if there are any updates that can be done and then doing them. This update command works similar to the `skm linux install` by checking dependencies, checking the branch is up todate and rebuiling the splashkit files if there is a new update.
