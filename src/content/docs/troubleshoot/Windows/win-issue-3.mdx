   If any of these paths are missing:
     - Click **New** (red box) and add the missing path.
     - Replace any username-specific segments with your actual Windows username.

   Once added, click **OK** in all windows to save the changes.

4. **Restart MINGW64 Terminal**

   Open a **new** MINGW64 terminal window and try running the `skm` command again.

</Steps>

These steps should resolve the issue, enabling the `skm` command to function as expected in your terminal.
